# Herdr lifecycle declaration - NOT ENABLED
**HARD SAFETY GATE:** this scaffold cannot inspect the task text filled in above.
If the task will start, stop, delete, restart, profile, or otherwise drive Herdr lifecycle behavior, stop and regenerate the brief with `--herdr-lab` before dispatch.
Do not add Herdr lifecycle commands to this unguarded brief by hand.

# Setup
You are in a disposable git worktree of zoetrope, at a detached HEAD on a clean default branch.

**Verify isolation before anything else.** Run `pwd -P` and `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; both must resolve to the disposable task worktree you were launched in, such as a treehouse pool path or an Orca-managed worktree, not the primary checkout firstmate operates from.
The path check is authoritative: `git rev-parse --git-dir` and `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` can help inspect the repo, but they do not prove you are outside the primary checkout.
If the top-level path is the primary checkout or not the worktree you were launched in, STOP - do not branch or commit here - append `blocked [at=<epoch>]: launched in primary checkout, not an isolated worktree` to the status file and stop.

1. First action: create your branch: `git checkout -b fm/ship-t2`

# Rules
1. Never push to the default branch (push only your `fm/ship-t2` branch). Never merge a PR.
2. Stay inside this worktree; modify nothing outside it except new raw notes under Project knowledge, plus the single `/_vaults/*/raw/` line the project-vault skill may have you append to the project's long-lived clone's repository-local exclude file.
3. Use gh-axi for GitHub operations and chrome-devtools-axi for browser operations.
4. Report status by appending one line:
   `echo "{state} [at=<epoch>]: {one short line}" >> '/var/folders/kb/v4dnb5gj6nl8pm3yy31nzw9w0000gn/T/tmp.Dhoi3D3HzV/home/state/ship-t2.status' && { [ ! -e '/var/folders/kb/v4dnb5gj6nl8pm3yy31nzw9w0000gn/T/tmp.Dhoi3D3HzV/home/config/fleet-ledger' ] || '/Users/pike/.no-mistakes/worktrees/81f2a0639ef5/01M3B8AN946KN651B2C0T1WQ03/bin/fm-fleet-ledger.sh' appended '/var/folders/kb/v4dnb5gj6nl8pm3yy31nzw9w0000gn/T/tmp.Dhoi3D3HzV/home/config' '/var/folders/kb/v4dnb5gj6nl8pm3yy31nzw9w0000gn/T/tmp.Dhoi3D3HzV/home/state/ship-t2.status' >/dev/null 2>&1 || true; }`
   States: working, needs-decision, blocked, paused, done, failed.
   Substitute `<epoch>` with the current Unix time in seconds - run `date +%s` and write the number it printed; a stamp that is not plain digits records no time at all.
   Each append wakes firstmate, so report sparingly: only phase changes a supervisor
   would act on (setup done, bug reproduced, fix implemented, validation passed) and the
   needs-decision/blocked/paused/done/failed states. No step-by-step FYI progress lines;
   firstmate reads your pane for that.
   Whenever you mention a PR anywhere - a status line, your terminal, a summary - write its full
   https:// URL exactly as the forge printed it, never a bare number such as "PR 108"; firstmate
   copies that URL from your line rather than assembling one.
   A mid-task `working:` line (including setup complete) is nonterminal: do not end the
   turn after it; continue the same stage until a defined `done:` gate under Definition of done.
   Use `paused: {why}` - distinct from `blocked:` - ONLY when you are deliberately idling on a
   known external wait you expect to clear on its own (an upstream release, a rate-limit reset, a scheduled window, or your own validation round):
   firstmate then leaves your idle pane alone and rechecks it on a long
   cadence instead of treating it as a possible wedge. Use `blocked:` when you are stuck and need help.
5. If you hit the same obstacle twice, append `blocked [at=<epoch>]: {why}` and stop; firstmate will help.
6. If a decision belongs above the implementation worker (product choices, destructive actions),
   append `needs-decision [at=<epoch>]: {summary of options}` and stop. Firstmate will reply with the decision.

   A decision or blocker you opened stays open until a `resolved` line carrying its exact key lands; a later `done:` or `working:` line never closes it, even when the answer is what started that work.
   Firstmate's reply normally writes that closing line at answer time; when a blocker or wait clears WITHOUT a firstmate reply, append `resolved [at=<epoch>]: {how it cleared}` yourself (same `[key=<slug>]` if you opened it with one) as you resume.
7. Never stop, restart, or update the shared `no-mistakes` daemon - it is one instance serving
   every lane/home, so restarting it kills other lanes' in-flight pipeline runs; only firstmate
   manages the daemon.
   Before you append `blocked:` about the pipeline, run `no-mistakes daemon status` and
   `no-mistakes axi status`. If the daemon socket refuses connections or is missing, append
   `blocked [at=<epoch>]: {the daemon error}` and stop even when the local run record still says running or
   fixing, because that record can be stale after the daemon exits. A run record failed with a
   daemon error is also a real block.
   Only after ruling out socket refusal, if the run is still running or fixing, reattach and keep
   going. A drive-call error, timeout, slow read, or generic unreachability is NOT a daemon error:
   the daemon accepts `respond` immediately and runs the round in the background, so a killed or
   timed-out call was only waiting for a read while the run kept working.

# Firstmate instruction inbox
Firstmate steers you through durable message files in '/var/folders/kb/v4dnb5gj6nl8pm3yy31nzw9w0000gn/T/tmp.Dhoi3D3HzV/home/state/ship-t2.inbox'.
When a terminal message says an instruction is waiting there - and at any natural checkpoint when you are unsure - list '/var/folders/kb/v4dnb5gj6nl8pm3yy31nzw9w0000gn/T/tmp.Dhoi3D3HzV/home/state/ship-t2.inbox'/*.msg, read and act on each message in numeric order, then acknowledge each handled message by moving it: `mv '/var/folders/kb/v4dnb5gj6nl8pm3yy31nzw9w0000gn/T/tmp.Dhoi3D3HzV/home/state/ship-t2.inbox'/NNN.msg '/var/folders/kb/v4dnb5gj6nl8pm3yy31nzw9w0000gn/T/tmp.Dhoi3D3HzV/home/state/ship-t2.inbox'/handled/`.
The move IS the acknowledgement: without it firstmate rings again and eventually treats you as stuck. An empty or absent inbox needs no action.

# Project knowledge
Project knowledge lives in this project's own repository as a vault, and `/Users/pike/.no-mistakes/worktrees/81f2a0639ef5/01M3B8AN946KN651B2C0T1WQ03/.agents/skills/project-vault/SKILL.md` owns that convention: read it before you read, create, or change a vault.
The firstmate repository itself is outside the convention and keeps its knowledge as it is.
Before you scan the code, read `_vaults/<name>/wiki/index.md` for the app you are working on when it exists, and follow its routing; the project's own vault rules and checks win over the skill.
When the project has no vault for that app, compile one inside this task's PR from the repository scan you do anyway to understand the code, as the skill describes; never widen that scan into a survey.
Otherwise add or update wiki notes only for what this task taught you, inside this task's PR; there are no separate documentation sweeps.
If this task's PR targets another owner's upstream repository, as a fork's contribution does, skip both: that PR carries no `_vaults/` content and no vault `.gitignore` block, because a fork's vault ships only in PRs to our own fork; local raw notes are still allowed.
Cut that PR's branch from the upstream's default branch, never from the fork's main, which may already carry the vault; if you cannot, stop and report instead of opening the PR.
Keep raw working notes only in this home's long-lived clone, under `/var/folders/kb/v4dnb5gj6nl8pm3yy31nzw9w0000gn/T/tmp.Dhoi3D3HzV/relproj/zoetrope/_vaults/<name>/raw/`, never inside this disposable worker copy, which is discarded at cleanup.
Write each raw note as a new file named `<YYYY-MM-DD>-ship-t2-<topic>.md` there and never edit another worker's note, so concurrent workers never collide; the skill says how to keep that clone clean, and without that clone keep no raw notes.

The vault is where project knowledge goes; a project `AGENTS.md` at most points to the vault index.
If `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` already exists, or this task adds that vault pointer, run `/Users/pike/.no-mistakes/worktrees/81f2a0639ef5/01M3B8AN946KN651B2C0T1WQ03/bin/fm-ensure-agents-md.sh .` in the worktree.
Record in `AGENTS.md` only what is useful to almost every future session.
For anything the codebase already shows, prefer a pointer to the authoritative file, command, or doc over copying the detail.
If you touch a project `AGENTS.md`, follow `/Users/pike/.no-mistakes/worktrees/81f2a0639ef5/01M3B8AN946KN651B2C0T1WQ03/bin/fm-ensure-agents-md.sh`'s self-governance contract in the same pass.
Keep it proportionate: skip `AGENTS.md` edits for trivial tasks that produced no durable project knowledge.

# Definition of done
Delivery contract: mode=direct-PR
This task ships **direct-PR**: you raise the PR yourself, without the no-mistakes pipeline.
The task is complete only when committed on your branch.
When it is implemented and committed, push your branch and open a PR with `gh-axi` that is ready for review, not a draft.
Before you report done, read the PR back from the forge and confirm it is not a draft (`gh pr view <url> --json isDraft` must print false); if it is a draft, mark it ready with `gh-axi pr ready`.
A draft cannot be merged, so a done report on one leaves the merge unasked.
Then append `done [at=<epoch>]: PR {url}` to the status file and stop.
That `done:` is accepted only when this copy's HEAD - your latest commit - is pushed to your PR branch; the check tests that commit, not merely that a branch moved.
If you deliberately keep the PR a draft, append `paused [at=<epoch>]: {why the draft is held}` instead of done.
Do NOT run /no-mistakes. The configured merge authority decides whether to merge the PR; firstmate relays the outcome.
