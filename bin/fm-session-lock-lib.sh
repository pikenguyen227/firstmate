# Shared session-lock harness identity.

# ONE owner of the "which verified-harness process holds this home's session
# lock, and does the current process run inside that same session?" decision.
# bin/fm-lock.sh uses it to acquire and inspect state/.lock and its
# state/.lock-session sidecar; bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh uses it to prove a
# Stop hook fires inside the lock-owning primary session before it may arm or
# rewake. Two signals decide ownership, either one sufficient: the recorded pid
# is a member of this process's contiguous harness ancestry, or the trusted
# Claude session id below matches the id recorded beside a live lock. Neither
# signal ever fails open: no id, no sidecar, an untrusted id, or a different
# recorded id leaves the ancestry verdict exactly as it was. A third verdict,
# fm_session_lock_owner_reclaimable, never grants ownership: it only lets a
# trusted Claude session take over, through bin/fm-lock.sh, a live owner pid
# that provably holds no live conversation of the lock.
# This file is sourced by scripts and has no side effects on source.

# Cursor process identity is NOT expressible as a command-name pattern and is
# deliberately not added to the tables below: Cursor's installed names are
# cursor-agent and the far-too-generic legacy alias `agent`, and it runs as a
# bundled node script. bin/fm-cursor-lib.sh is the fleet's single owner of that
# decision, so this file delegates to it rather than widening the name match.

# --- trusted same-session identity -------------------------------------------
# Claude Code hands every hook and tool shell CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID (the
# session's conversation id) and CLAUDE_PID (the pid of the process running the
# model loop). A background session runs that model loop in a transient helper
# bridged to its front-end by a shared daemon, and when that bridge is recycled
# the contiguous claude-named ancestry from a hook to the recorded lock owner
# breaks while the owner pid stays alive, so ancestry alone reads the session's
# own lock as another live session's. The id is the one identity that survives
# the recycling, so it is accepted as a second ownership signal - but only from
# an environment proven to belong to the current Claude run.
#
# Trust gate: CLAUDE_PID must be a Claude-shaped member of this process's
# contiguous harness ancestry. An id merely retained in a helper environment
# fails that membership and is ignored: a hand-started Pi or codex primary under
# a Claude pane still carries the pane's CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID and CLAUDE_PID,
# and must never own a lock with them. Ids are read from the environment only,
# never from ps argv, where prompts and briefs are visible.
#
# A --fork-session successor mints a new id, so it stays a foreign live owner
# until the pre-fork process exits; that is the safe direction and a documented
# non-goal. Two genuinely different live sessions sharing one id is not a
# supported state (Claude refuses to resume a running session under its id).
